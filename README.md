# Project

A strategy-led toolkit translating complex insights into structured decision systems.

This repository serves as a professional portfolio project, showcasing how abstract problems—often encountered in consulting, presales, and data-driven decision contexts—can be reframed into clear, actionable systems.

Rather than focusing on individual features or technologies, this project emphasizes:
- Structured problem framing
- Decision-oriented system design
- The translation of insights into repeatable frameworks

The tools and frameworks here are designed to support high-stakes decision-making, where clarity, alignment, and execution matter.
